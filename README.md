Use provided boilerplate code with the IntelliJ IDE. Linking the algs4 library is taken care of that way.
Use "javac-algs4" and "java-algs4" when the algs4 library is involved.
Use Git Bash, rather than powershell, when running either of these commands.
Use "javac -cp algs4.jar javafilename.java" instead of "javac-algs4 javafilename.java" if encountering issues where javac-algs4 is not recognized. This will require having algs4.jar in the same directory as the file you are trying to compile.
